### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

## Running the Backend

To ensure the backend is running well. You have to install first the dependancies and libraries of the flask and AI code. Make sure that the libraries are compatible to each other as this sometimes might cause some errors.
In order to install the libraries, run the following command.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Once you successfully install libraries, run the backend code by using the following command.
`python src/backend/server.py`

If the python code ran successfully, then you can start running the react website and then the website will appear.
